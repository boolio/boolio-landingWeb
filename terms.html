          <h1> 1. Information you provide us directly </h1> 
          <p>When you log in with Boolio, we ask for your real name,  e-mail address and a profile picture. You also have the option of logging in to the Boolio application with your Facebook login. If you use the Facebook login, we will collect data about you as detailed below. We may retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. Your real name and profile picture will be published publicly with any User Content.</p> 
          <h1> 2. Information we may receive from third parties</h1>
          <p>We will receive information about you when you register for  the Service using Facebook login. Facebook may pass certain information about you to Boolio upon login. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, and any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us.</p>
          <h1>3. Analytics information</h1>
          <p>We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools and services, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.</p>

          <h1>4. Cookies information</h1>
          <p>When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Boolio help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.  </p>

          <h1>5. Log file information</h1>
          <p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p>

          <p>Who can see User Content: Any User Content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service becomes available to the public. Once posted on Boolio, User Content may not be removable from public view, as copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, on other sites that have republished us, or if other Users have copied or saved that information. If you do not wish your User Content to be available to the public, please don’t post it on Boolio. Your real name will be published publicly with any User Content. Once published your real name may not be able to be removed. You may delete User Content within the Boolio mobile application, or you may request removal of User Content by contacting us as team@boolio.io.</p>

          <h1>Sharing certain service type information we collect about you</h1>
          <p>We may share certain service type information, including information obtained through tools such as cookies, log files, and device identifiers (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.): (i) with our third-party business partners for the purposes described in the section above on “How We Collect and Use Information.” We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally identifying characteristics and may share that aggregated, anonymized data with third parties.
